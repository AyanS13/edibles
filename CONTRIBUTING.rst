1. When you're done making changes, check that your changes pass flake8 and the tests, including testing other Python versions with tox::

    flake8 edibles
    coverage run -m pytest

   To get flake8, just pip install it into your virtualenv.

2. Commit your changes and push your branch to GitLab::

    git add .
    git commit -m "Your detailed description of your changes."
    git push origin name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature

   When pushing your commit, the tests are automatically run on gitlab.

3. Submit a pull request or merge request with master through the GitLab website.
