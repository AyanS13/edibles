This directory contains all sorts of information related to the
EDIBLES sightlines; this information needs to be prepared and
formatted in such a way that the EDIBLES oracle class can read and use
the information. 

For all parameters, the oracle will expect a file called
"Formatted_XXX.csv" where XXX is the parameter name. Each of those
files should look like this (these are the first few lines of the
Formatted_EBV.csv file): 

object,value,unc_lower,unc_upper,reference_id,preferred_flag
HD 22951,0.23,NaN,NaN,4,0
HD 22951,0.23,NaN,NaN,2,0
HD 23016,0.06,NaN,NaN,4,0
HD 23016,0.06,NaN,NaN,2,0
HD 23180,0.3,0.04,0.04,3,1
HD 23180,0.31,NaN,NaN,4,0
HD 23180,0.31,NaN,NaN,2,0

The reference_id is a number that refers to the file
ParameterReferences.csv: 

reference_ID,nickname,doi,url,comments
1,SIMBAD,,"http://simbad.u-strasbg.fr/simbad/sim-fid","Directly taken from SIMBAD"
2,Tycho,,,
3,Valencic04,"https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/link_gateway/2004ApJ...616..912V/doi:10.1086/424922","https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1086/424922/fulltext/60787.tables.html"
4,EBV_SIMBAD,,"http://simbad.u-strasbg.fr/simbad/sim-fid","(B-V) from SIMBAD; intrinsic colors from FitzGerald 1970"
99,Unknown,,,

The preferred_flag is 1 is that particular row corresponds to the
value that is to be preferred. 

Since many of the parameters have their own set of source data and
differences in preferred values, it makes sense to process each
parameter independently in its own script. This is done e.g. in
"Format_EBV.py". 

An older script ('ReformatTable.py') aimed to accomplish the same by
starting from a set of Input*.csv files that were essentially created
from the Master google target spreadsheet and that created
corresponding "Targets_*.csv" files. This, however, is not sufficient
to process everything we need, and eventually, we will remove the
Targets*.csv files as well as the ReformatTable.py script.
